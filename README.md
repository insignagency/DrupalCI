## Our first file is the Dockefile of our CI project. 



## Getting Started 

A Dockerfile is a smart text tool allowing the user to recall all images commands in a more compact and effective way. You can find additional info on how to set this file at the following link:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/


## Prerequisites
Install Docker and essential Linux commands if you're under Linux environment. 
You can alternatively follow this link if you're using Windows OS
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/


## Installing

Download automated build from public Docker Hub Registry
(or alternatively you can build an image from Dockerfile: `docker build -t="dockerfile/"image name" .` , then running the Dockerfile in the current folder). `
